The source code of ncregrid is available under the GNU General Public License
(GPL, see GPL.txt). Since the GPL was not written for scientific software,
the following additional terms apply for using ncregrid: 

* If you implement ncregrid (fully or partly) in your own code
  (e.g., into a global 3-dimensional model), please cite
  the present publication
    (Technical Note: Recursive rediscretisation of geo-scientific data
     in multiple dimensions in the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy) data
     import interface in Atmos. Chem. Phys. (2006),
     available at http://www.atmos-chem-phys.org)
  in the 'Model description' section (or equivalent) of resulting
  publications. 
* If you use ncregrid as 'stand-alone' program for handling your data,
  I would appreciate a note in the 'Acknowledgements' of your resulting
  publications. 
* Please send me a reprint of your publication. I would also appreciate
  a preprint when you submit your manuscript. 
* If you change or extend ncregrid (by writing additional code),
  you must also make it available using this (or a similar license).
  This includes also code (e.g. Makefile) for porting ncregrid to other
  platforms.
  Please e-mail your new code to
     ncregrid@p-joeckel.de
  This will help me to coordinate further developments of the code.
