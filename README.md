This is just a mirror of the original source from http://www.pa.op.dlr.de/~PatrickJoeckel/ncregrid/ncregrid.tar.Z

The Makefile has been changed slightly to provide a binary that is statically linked to some Fortran libraries but still dynamically linked to `libnetcdf`. It is also designed to be build with Anaconda. You can find an already build, ready to install version on http://anaconda.org/birdhouse/ncregrid.
